# Marine Commander 2000 Online Edition - README 

During my younger years, I was engrossed in a classic board game, "Marine Commander 2000". With the dual goal of learning Rust and JavaScript, and bringing this beloved game to a digital platform, this project came into existence.

The principal objective was to create a functional online game complete with sound effects, which have been adopted from the original version. As for future updates, I am uncertain about the likelihood of refactoring the codebase or adding other game features like radar and such.

You can contribute to the development of this project by visiting the Issues page and addressing some of the listed features that have yet to be implemented.
